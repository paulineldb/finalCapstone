                            <p>Hi! My name is Pauline and I am the creator of this website. Upon being prompted to work on a project showcasing a hobby, talent, or passion, I knew right away that I would focus on one of the Dungeons and Dragons (also known as DnD or D&D for short) campaigns I am currently playing in: The Onyx Isle.</p>
                            <p><i>Note:</i> The campaign, its setting and all NPCs (nonplayer characters) have been created by our amazing DM, Benjamin Thornton. Each played character (which you can find on the <a href="characters.html" target="_blank">characters</a> page) has been created by their respective player.</p>

                        <h3>What is Dungeons and Dragons?</h3>
                        <p>"In Dungeons & Dragons, the players form an adventuring party who explore fantasy worlds together as they embark on epic quests and level up in experience. The Dungeon Master (also known as the DM) is the game's referee and storyteller. There’s no winning or losing in D&D—at least, not in the conventional way.</p>
                        <p>At its heart, D&D is a game that focuses on storytelling. The dice just help you along. Everything is your decision, from what you look like, to how you act, to what happens next.</p>
                        <p>The collective creativity in your D&D game builds stories that you’ll tell again and again—ranging from the stuff of legend to absurd incidents that’ll make you laugh years later."</p>
                        <p><i>Source: <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/what-is-dnd" target="_blank">Dungeons & Dragons</a></i></p>
                        <p>In summary, DnD is a group storytelling game in which anything is possible. Want to be a halfling thief on a quest to fortune? Can do. Would rather be a half-orc softie that casts spells to speak to animals and plants? Can do too. If you really wanted to, you could even be a vampire allergic to blood! All  you need is a little bit of imagination and a couple of dice.  </p>

                            <p>Our group for this campaign is made of a DM: Benjamin, and five players: Sarah, Salty, Matt, Squizy and myself! We have been playing together on-and-off since March 2021 and started on our adventure in August 2021. We have been playing every Sunday (except for the odd canceled session here and there) ever since. Dnd allowed us to create and develop relationships between our characters, but also amongst ourselves. Playing the game can also sometimes be challenging, disagreements happen and tensions can result from them, but we have learned to communicate and have created a space where we feel safe to share feelings and frustrations. </p>
