                    <p>The Onyx Isle can currently be found in a demiplane-like prison. It is ruled over by 6 gods (also known as Custodians) who are similar to well... prison wardens! They are not true gods but divine beings chosen by the Gods of their namesakes (Wealth, Death, Nature, Justice, Land and Knowledge).</p>
                    <p>The Isle was originally part of a larger world, from which it was broken from and trapped in a demiplane after a threat presented itself to the world and failed to be killed. There exist additional islands outside the purview of the "Gods".</p>

                            <p>Helia is the twin brother to Hunraesa. He is studious and obsessed with the notion of advancing society, often to the detriment of his sister and himself as well.</p>
                            <p>When looking for students or prodigies, he is drawn to the ones that seek knowledge and self-betterment. Once a powerful Wizard, he chose to share what he knew (contrary to most of the other Wizards who hoard their knowledge), making him equally well-liked and hated amongst the magic community.</p>
                            <p>Many wizards who are brave enough to seek out magical knowledge have twisted his philosophy on sharing magic and knowledge to hoard it and keep it secret for themselves or use their knowledge to find other mages and report them to steal their secrets.

                            <p><u>Depiction:</u> Helia is depicted as a very old, serious Halfling man, most people's stereotypical vision of what a Wizard is (imagine a Hobbit-sized Gandalf).</p>
