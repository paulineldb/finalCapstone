# Capstone project: The Onyx Isle - a D&D adventure

This is my first (ever) website built using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.
This project was created while studying on the HyperionDev Web Development bootcamp. It was designed as an answer to the prompt 'Create a website to showcase a hobby, talent or passion of yours.'

### The website
This is a responsive website that allows the visitor to discover/learn more about the table-top RPG game Dungeons&Dragons through the presentation of a campaign called The Onyx Isle.
The website contains 4 pages: 
* Homepage
* World / Lore page
* Player characters page
* Save for later page

### Features
* save an item from the 3 main pages on a 'save for later' page.
* like content
* leave comments on the homepage
* contribute a Non-Player Character name for the Dungeon Master to use in the campaign
* vote for a favorite character
* contact form


> Credits: all creative content present on the website has been created by our DM, Benjamin Thornton (contact details available if you have any questions!)
